    "## 1. Why version control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping with the \"Document everything you do\" mentality, you need to start thinking about how to manage changes to your analysis or modelling projects early on. Imagine the following common situation. You have a working analysis script, but you decide to do additional analyses requested by your colleague/advisor/reviewer. You make the required changes, and while your new analysis works fine, suddely you find that you can't replicate your previous analyses - they give you an error or results that differ from what you had before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens surprisingly often. One way to deal with that is to always backup you scripts, and make the changes to new files. While this may work for the simplest of cases, it becomes unwieldy quickly and you can end up with 10 versions of your analyses at which point you are in a no better situation than you were before, because you have to figure out which script contains the version of the code you need. If you work collaboratively on the same analyses, this becomes even more problematic."

    "## 2. What are git and GitHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "Step in version control with [git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a system which allows you to track the changes you or others make to your files/scripts, to log the purpose of those changes and to go back and forth between different versions of your files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that for each project you manage, you establish what is called a *repository* for that project with git. That repository contains the files for your project, and using various commands you can instruct it what to do when you make changes to your files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a command-line tool, which you control by typing commands in a console/terminal. If you are not comfortable doing that, you can use a GUI (graphical user interface) application. One is provided when you install git, but a much better one comes with GitHub, which has a familiar user-interface that allows you to just point-and-click to the most common options. The command-line tool is more versatile, and I recommend learning how to use it, but the end goal is to get the job done, and if you prefer to use the app, go ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what about GitHub then? Well, git allows you to create repositories on your own computer. GitHub is a complementary service, which allows you to host your repositories on the [github.com](github.com) platform. That way you can share your work with collaborators, access it on different computers, and the changes you make are all synced to this central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you will need to:\n",
    "* know how to open and use a command line / console / terminal - check [this](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) for windows and [this](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp) for unix/linux/mac\n",

    "Adding files means telling git that it should track changes in those files. However, in contrast to the \"Track changes\" options in Word, it does not do it continuously and automatically - you have to tell git when you want the changes you've made to be recorded! Git calls this \"commiting\". There is a good reason for this - you want to record changes at specific identifiable moments which can allow you to go back to a specific version you need. Let's say that you have just spent some time revising your analysis script by changing the regression model you are using. You can commit your new changes with the commit command. You also want to describe briefly the changes you've made so that you can identify the version later. You do this by adding -m \"My description\" to the commit command:\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point you might be asking what is the point of all of this? You have made changes and saved them, but this hasn't really affected any part of your workflow. Let's talk about branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you imagine your project as a tree, you can think of each branch of a tree as an alternative version of your project. You can work on multiple versions/branches of your project at the same time. Your main branch is called **master**. It is automatically created when you initialize a repository and unless you create other branches, it will be the only one. At any point in time, you will always be in a certain branch, and any changes you make to your files at that time will only be made to files in that branch. When you create a new branch, you make a copy of the branch from which you created it. Importantly, this does not actually copy your files, and if you go into your project folder you will not see anything different at that point. Once you've made and commit any changes, you can switch between branches. Any time you switch to a branch, the files in your folder will be replaced with the files corresponding to the last changes in the branch. You can also merge branches together, implementing changes from one branch into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this useful? A very common workflow that protects your files is one in which you have two branches, a **master** branch, and a **development** branch. In this setup, you never work in your master branch - you always make changes in the development branch and once you are satisfied with those changes, you merge them into your master branch. That allows you to easily switch between your current in-progress changes and your last working version of your script in your master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch and switch to it you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b nameofnewbranch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you can make any changes to your project that you like, and use the commands discussed before to add the files and commit your changes. When you do this, your newbranch will contain your changes, but your **master** branch will contain a version of the repository prior to the creation of the new branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **`checkout`** commandas allows you not only to create new branches, when putting the **`-b branchname`** operator, but also to switch from one branch to another existing one. To do that, type the command without the **-b** operator, with the name of the branch you want to switch into. If you want to go back to your master branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you now check your files, they should not contain the changes you made. You can easily go back to that branch with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout nameofnewbranch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 3.7 Merging branches\n",
    "\n",
    "You've finished making your changes on your development  branch (called **dev**), you have tested them, and you want to finalize them. You need to merge your *dev* branch with your *master*. Any time you merge two branches together, git compares their contents, checks for conflicts and combines any changes made in the different branches. In the simplest case, where you've only made changes to one of the branches, it will just replace the files in the other with the newer version. If, you've made changes to the same file under different branches, it will try to merge them. If the changes are about different parts of the file, it will combine them with no problem most of the time. If the changes are to the same lines in a file, it will create a conflict error that you will have to resolve manually. For now, just avoid doing that, and let's assume you've made changes only to one branch. When you merge branches, you implement the changes in whatever branch you are currently in. So, to update our master branch with the contents of **dev**, we first switch to **master**, and then invoke the merge command like this:\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "git branch -d weirdtestbranch\n",
